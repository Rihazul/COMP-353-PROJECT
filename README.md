## Description:
This project aims to develop a Private Online Community Social Network System using MySQL Database Management System. The COSN is designed to serve as a virtual gathering place for local communities, enabling members to connect, share information, and engage in meaningful interactions. The system will empower users to create detailed profiles, manage friend lists, and share a variety of content, including text posts, images, and links. To enhance active participation, users will be allowed to comment on and react to shared content. A private messaging system will allow users to communicate directly with each other, enabling private conversations and discussions. Additionally, the COSN will allow users to form groups based on shared interests or affiliations, fostering focused discussions within dedicated forums. The COSN hopes to reach a stable and scalable platform where communities can thrive in the digital world, using MySQL's robust functionalities. It will be built with particular attention to all industry best practices on data security and privacy protection.
